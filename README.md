# Colorado Golden Retrievers

## About Us
We have been raising and training golden retrievers for almost 20 years. 

## Gretel
Gretel is a dark red golden from a line of distinguished field dogs. She is an absolute sweetheart---she is wonderful with children, cats, other animals and, above-all, with people! Her intelligence, focus, and drive have made her easy to train. She earned her first scent work titles at just 8 months old, her Tracking Dog (TD) title at 14 months, and her Tracking Dog Excellent (TDX) title a year later.
