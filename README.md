## About Us


## Gretel
Gretel is a dark red golden from a line of distinguished field dogs. She is an absolute sweetheart---wonderful with children, cats, other animals and, above-all, with people! Her strong drive has made her easy to train. She earned her first scent work titles at just 8 months old, her Tracking Dog (TD) title at 14 months, and her Tracking Dog Excellent (TDX) title a year later.
